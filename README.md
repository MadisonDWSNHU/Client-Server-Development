# Client-Server-Development
This project uses MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook, and Python

About the Project/Project Title
This project involved the creation of a dashboard for an international animal rescue called “Grazioso Salvare”. This company finds dog breeds that are statistically highly intelligent and obedient for the usage of search and rescue training. 

Motivation
Grazioso Salvare needs software to efficiently search through data containing dog breeds for the purpose of categorizing intelligence and obedience levels among them, automating their process of choosing dogs for their mission. 

Development Process 
This application uses a database through MongoDB. Jupyter Notebooks and Python are used here to connect to the database, using MongoCRUD principals. A python file was generated, then a IPYNB file to test the code and analyze the data.
